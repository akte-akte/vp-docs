# Hello Docs :wave:

This is made with VuePress. I've been a fan for a while.

- [x] documentation is good
- [x] markdown is good

## How to run this

Install it

```bash
npm install
```

Serve it

```bash
vuepress dev docs
```

## What more could I do?

:shrug: Whatever you would normally do in Vue, it is designed for docs but you can use Vue logic within your pages. I might add some mark-down plug-ins to fix those busted checkboxes.
